## How to Rotation calculation work in this project

      For hours
         12 hours = 360 deg
         1 hour = 360/12
         hRotation = 30h + m/2 (60 mint = 30 deg => 1 mint = 30/60 = (1/2)m)

      For minute
        60 mint(1 hour) = 360 deg
        1 mint = 360/60 = 6
        mRotation = 6m

      For second
        60 sec(1 mint) = 360 deg
        1 sec = 360/60 = 6
        sRotation = 6s
